How to use my code:

1. Open Code_SID540293775 in MATLAB.
2. Press Run to run the high- level script.
3. Choose sound source by entering densil or snare or music.
4. Choose the distance of sound by entering number, recommended range from 1-10 m, but not mandatory.
5. Choose the azimuth angle of sound, recommended ranging from 0 to 355 degrees with a 5-degree interval.
6. You will get the sound result from headphone or speaker. Also, a graph of frequency response.
7. The demo will automatically be stored at the same file called "demo".

Note: This system works better over headphone.
